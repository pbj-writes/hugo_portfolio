## Next Step

Last year I dove into the docs-as-code world. I was mesmerized and intimidated by all the available tools out there. Since those initial findings and feelings, I've become more familiar with markdown and static site generators. One gaping hole in my attempt to grasp everything-as-code is diagramming. The first tool that I was exposed to was [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org).

## Opportunity
In my Bicycle Inventory API project, I had the opportunity to give Mermaid a try to show an entity relationship diagram [](../portfolio/).
