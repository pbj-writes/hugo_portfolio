## There isn't a release notes class

In college, my professional writing program didn't include a class on release notes. Why would it! I'm sure this is not uncommon in a lot of technical communication programs. Perhaps release notes are a subject of a class, but how often are release notes the entire class? We face many expectations not covered in our academic experiences. 

## Initial lessons

The first time that I was asked to prepare release notes, the project was technically on its first release. The first release shouldn't need release notes, right? In this case, there had been some pre-releases, demos, and walkthroughs, so I was expected to communicate what had changed since the last time the customer had any touchpoints. I did some research and I found some guidance that made sense to me. Use concise sentences that start with a verb that connotes what happened. For instance, fixed, added, or enhanced.

## Intermediate lessons

For a time, my initial lessons worked well for me, especially for fixes. Eventually, my initial lessons started to show cracks with new features and enhancements. The problem was if I started an enhancement with "Enhanced..." then I was creating these long meandering sentence monstrosities. My rules were too rigid.
