# Bicycle Inventory API App
> **NOTE**  
> In progress. I'm working on developing some sweet mermaid skillz to create design and data model diagrams. Also, I'm intending to embed a demo video.

## Introduction

I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of APIs and demonstrate my API doc skills, so I set out to create a data-driven API application. I started with an idea to track all of my current and former bicycles. I knew that I could easily (but sloppily) design a bicycle data table. And from this point, I did a lot of searching.

## Tools
### Database
I can write SQL but I needed a solution to host my db online in the cloud. I came across [https://elephantsql.com](https://elephantsql.com). They offer to host a limited, but free, Postgres database instance.

### API server and code platform for APIs
I'm not a developer so finding how to write some basic APIs was intimidating, but after some [next-level](../../resume/#syracuse-university-) internet searching, I found a [step-by-step guide](https://dev.to/fredabod/a-step-by-step-guide-to-using-elephantsql-with-nodejs-and-express-2e9f) for using ElephantSQL with Node.js and Express. 

### IDE
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

### API Platform

## Design
> **TODO**  
> Learn mermaid and create a design artifact.

## Data Model

> Learn mermaid and create a data model artifact.

## Demo
> **TODO**  
> Record, post, and embed a demo.
