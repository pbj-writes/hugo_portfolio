## Data 💾
At Syracuse University's iSchool, every professor started each class saying, <mark>'It's all about the data'.</mark> I learned SQL painfully through graduate courses such as database administration and metadata. I started applying these skills in a position where I tested and helped put into production an Oracle database application. I further utilized my SQL skills in testing simulation and optimization applications that required clean, production data. Later, I was given the responsibility of creating MySQL databases and tables, then loading and troubleshooting customer data.

## DevOps 🏗️
In one role, I was hired as a technical writer. The team, like many, was a light weight development team where everybody had to do a bit of everything. In my case, I stepped up on DevOps throughout the CI/CD lifecycle under the tutelage of a senior engineering architect. Some of my DevOps tasks were to:
- spin up  pre-packaged servers
- install Docker on pre-packaged servers
- add new GIT repos and Jenkins automations with configured project application code
- set up development applications and Tableau Server in Docker containers
- configure development and production environments
- create application databases and loading application data
- onboard teammates and customers
- enforce user management and security/certificate policies
- manage application and Tableau Server licenses
- update scripts to create and push application docker images
