## PBJ the Athlete
### Basketball🏀
My first love was basketball. Basketball taught me that when I put in the time and effort that success will follow. I have carried this lesson into all aspects of my life.

### Cycling🚲
By college, I knew that my basketball path was over, and I transitioned into triathlon. I learned quickly that I didn't like swimming, but I found cycling. Since college, my obsession has grown to a full-blown compulsion. And more and more of my time is spent training, watching races, and learning about the latest tools and gear. My compulsion is at the point to where my partner thinks that I should merge my compulsion with my career.

## PBJ the Professional👨🏻‍💻

### Writer✍🏻 and Librarian📚
These are my credentials - B.A. in Professional Writing and M.S. in Library and Information Science. Sure, I have these skills and these are my core competancies but my professional skills don't end there.

### Data💾
At Syracuse University's iSchool, every professor started each class saying, <mark>'It's all about the data'.</mark> I painfully learned SQL through graduate courses such as database administration and metadata. I started applying these skills in a position where I tested and helped put into production an Oracle database application. I further utilized my SQL skills in testing simulation and optimization applications that required clean, production data. Later, I was given the responsibility of creating MySQL databases and tables, then loading and troubleshooting customer data.

### DevOps🏗️
In one role, I was hired as a technical writer. The team, like many, was a light weight development team where everybody had to do a bit of everything. In my case, I stepped up on DevOps throughout the CI/CD lifecycle under the tutelage of a senior engineering architect. Some of my DevOps tasks were to:
- spin up  pre-packaged servers
- install Docker on pre-packaged servers
- add new GIT repos and Jenkins automations with configured project application code
- set up development applications and Tableau Server in Docker containers
- configure development and production environments
- create application databases and loading application data
- onboard teammates and customers
- enforce user management and security/certificate policies
- manage application and Tableau Server licenses
- update scripts to create and push application docker images 

### Testing and QA🧪
As a technical writer, testing and QA is a key part of the profession. Some of my QA responsibilities were to:
- step through application user interfaces 
- review localized versions of user interfaces
- adapt automated test scripts
- write test cases
- cleanup code
- query data
