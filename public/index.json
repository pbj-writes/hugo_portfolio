The following examples show some of the variety of my work. Relationship Diagram A software application that I was documenting had an adjuster package that would adjust calculated values. The adjuster package has sets, rules, and qualifiers. I needed a way to depict the relationship between these three components of the adjuster package in order for users to grasp how to configure the adjusters. For instance, a set may have more than one rule but a rule can only have one qualifier. Another insight communicated in the diagram is that qualifiers do not need to be associated with a rule because a qualifier may have expired or is planned for the future. Document Workflow Diagram As a new hire, I wanted to understand how my small software development team and I would produce user documentation. After a few months on the job, I was able to grasp the role that I needed to play but also the role that teammates would need to play in the user documentation life cycle. This workflow is what I presented to clear up any confusion about who does what, how user documentation is authored, the format of review documents, and how comments are documented. Software upgrade by Environment Workflow Diagram I worked a project that had a software application with two flavors—a forecast program and a real-time processing program. These two form factors shared a lot of code and resources since they essentially performed the same function except the forecast program processed historical data and the real-time program processed new, incoming data. Within these two programs, each had its own sub-environments. A need arose from technical teammates to understand how software upgrades would happen—where would they originate, what were the high-level steps, what to do if testing failed, etc. This workflow diagram accompanied a text description in a workflow document for the software.","title":""},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"","keywords":null,"link":"/portfolio/editing_samples/","tags":null,"text":"Editing Samples I have prepared two editing samples each with a context cover page.

The keys to using this template are: Always use the template Styles to format content; and If copy/pasting text from an external source (i.e., another document), always paste as plain text (also sometimes referred to as Keep Text Only). IMPORTANT Copying and pasting content (without pasting as text only) from another document can cause serious formatting conflicts in the document because new styles may be introduced to the existing template style set. use this template to format regular, paragrpah text Place cursor in desired area for regular, paragraph text. From the Microsoft Word Home tab, click Styles \u003e Para Txt. Type or paste text with Keep Text Only option. REMEMBER After text is entered, highlight the text and navigate to the Styles pane to verify that the Para Txt style is applied—the applied style will have a bold highlight around it. use this template to format figure captions After generating a figure caption, highlight the caption. From the Microsoft Word Home tab, click Figure Caption.","title":""},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"","keywords":null,"link":"/portfolio/style_guide_sample/","tags":null,"text":"Style Guide Sample In all my professional positions, I have contributed to a style guide or manual of some sort.
